# Flask_pi
Proposal Summary
Raspberry Pi based Autopilot Humidistat Thermostat and Fire Detector. Using DHT22 sensor, actuators and basic python frameworks and modules to sense temperature and humidity change, regulate it and represent data on web. On successful completion of project, assembly should be able to sense temperate change, manipulate it and regulate it using fan or heater if required. In addition, present data on designated localhost momentarily. Using SQLite database to store reading and diagrammatically present it on request. In addition, using Arduino Flame Detection Sensor the flame sensor would detect a fire outbreak, report and escalate to relevant quarters.

For instance, when the room temperature is 24 °C - 30 °C the fan is turned on automatically while if it is 10 °C - 15 °C the heater is turn on automatically. Lastly, the users would be allowed to create an account that they can be able to login to access the past recordings of the Raspberry Pi.

Goals
On successful completion of project, assembly should be able to
•	sense temperature change, manipulate it and regulate it using fan or heater if required.
•	Prevent fire disaster
•	To readings using database
•	Analytically present data on request
•	Send Notification to emergency contacts
